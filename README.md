Generative AI has seen a major impact in the recent time. For my Bachelorthesis I created an add-on for the Godot game engine to render a citybuild prototype and a chess game in Godot with the Stable Diffusion AI. Please note that the code is not well-structured throughout the complete project and that many things are hardcoded into it.

To try this project you need to have the Automatic1111 WebUI (https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) installed and running. If it does not run on 127.0.0.1:7860 you need to change the exported URL of the SD_Button in the sd_interface scene ("/godot_project/addons/stablediffusion_renderer/scenes/sd_interface.tscn"). If you want to change settings like the seed (settings that are hardcoded) you can open the script of the SD_Button and change it in the function "generateJsonFromData()". Make sure to change the settings for the correct API!

To toggle the UI of the citybuild game you can press the "I2 key. To toggle the interface of the add-on you can press the "." key and to switch the ingame viewport with the add-on viewport you can press "Alt+s".
