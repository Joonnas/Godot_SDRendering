Generative AI has seen a major impact in the recent time. For my Bachelorthesis I created an add-on for the Godot game engine to render a citybuild prototype and a chess game in Godot with the Stable Diffusion AI. Please note that the code is not well-structured throughout the complete project and that many things are hardcoded into it.

To try this project you need to have the Automatic1111 WebUI (https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) installed and running. If it does not run on 127.0.0.1:7860 you need to change the exported URL of the SD_Button in the sd_interface scene ("/godot_project/addons/stablediffusion_renderer/scenes/sd_interface.tscn").
Inside of the game you have three options: Depth game, Edge game and Chess. As it was first planned to create multiple small games for different modes of the ControlNet the first two are called this way. The Depth game is hereby the citybuild game, while there is no Edge game implemented.
